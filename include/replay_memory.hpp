 * @brief A memory structure for storing and replaying past experiences.
 * 
 * This class provides a more flexible implementation of replay memory
 * compared to ReplayBuffer, using a deque instead of a fixed-size array.
 * It is particularly useful for algorithms that require more complex 
 * sampling strategies.
