\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A memory structure for storing and replaying past experiences. 

This class provides a more flexible implementation of replay memory compared to \mbox{\hyperlink{classReplayBuffer}{Replay\+Buffer}}, using a deque instead of a fixed-\/size array. It is particularly useful for algorithms that require more complex sampling strategies. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
include/\mbox{\hyperlink{replay__memory_8hpp}{replay\+\_\+memory.\+hpp}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
